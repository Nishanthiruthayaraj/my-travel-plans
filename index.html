3 ========================== Review a Repo's History ==========================
--->git init
--->git clone
--->git log
		-->git log --oneline
		-->git log --stat 
		-->git log -p
--->git status

**** git init ****
1.) Before you can make commits or do anything else with a git repository, the repository needs to actually exist. To create a new repository with Git, we'll use the git init command.
2.) The command (git init) initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory.


"Clone repo into local machine and go to repo first"

--->git status (displays the state of the working directory and the 										staging area)

--->git log (utility tool to review and read a history of everything that 								happens to a repository)
	eg:---> git log -p fdf5493

--->to scroll down, press
		j or â†“ to move down one line at a time
		d to move by half the page screen
		f to move by a whole page screen


--->to scroll up, press
		k or â†‘ to move _up_ one line at a time
		u to move by half the page screen
		b to move by a whole page screen

--->press q to quit out of the log (returns to the regular command 									prompt)

--->git log --oneline  (command with just the short SHA(id) and the 						commit message.)

--->git log --stat   (command which lists the files that were changed as 				well as the number of added/removed lines)

--->git log -p  (The git log command has a flag that can be used to 				   display the actual changes made to a file. The 				   flag is --patch which can be shortened to just -p)

--->git show (only display the most recent commit)



4 ========================== Add commit to A Repo ==========================
##### Working directory --> Staging index --> Repository


##### Git Add Recap
		The git add command is used to move files from the Working Directory to the Staging 			Index.

--->git add <file1> <file2> â€¦ <fileN>
			This command:

				* takes a space-separated list of file names
				* alternatively, the period . can be used in place of a list of files to 				  tell Git to add the current directory (and all nested files)

--->git add index.html 
	--(git rm --cached <file_name> is not like the shell's rm command. git rm --cached will 		   not destroy any of your work; it just removes it from the Staging Index)
	
--->git add css/app.css js/app.js
							# would become
--->git add .



##### Git Commit Recap
	The git commit command takes files from the Staging Index and saves them in the 			repository.

--->git commit  (git commit -m "Commit comment")


##### Git Diff Recap
	To recap, the git diff command is used to see changes that have been made but haven't been 	committed, yet:

--->git diff    
		This command displays:
			the files that have been modified
			the location of the lines that have been added/removed
			the actual changes that have been made

##### Git Ignore
If you want to keep a file in your project's directory structure but make sure it isn't accidentally committed to the project, you can use the specially named file, .gitignore (note the dot at the front, it's important!). Add this file to your project in the same directory that the hidden .git directory is located. All you have to do is list the names of files that you want Git to ignore (not track) and it will ignore them.

Let's try it with the "project.docx" file. Add the following line inside the .gitignore file:

--->project.docx

 	### Inside ignore file
	Globbing lets you use special characters to match patterns/characters. In the .gitignore 	file, you can use the following:

	blank lines can be used for spacing
	# - marks line as a comment
	* - matches 0 or more characters
	? - matches 1 character
	[abc] - matches a, b, _or_ c
	** - matches nested directories - a/**/z matches
		a/z
		a/b/z
		a/b/c/z


5 ========================== Tagging, Branching, and Merging ==========================

--->git tag  (add tags to specific commit.)
--->git branches (you'll be able to create branches that let you develop different features of your project in parallel 
						without getting confused as to which commits belong to which feature.ble to develop different branches and features)
--->git checkout  (you'll be able to switch between different branches and tags.)
--->git merge  (you can use it to take changes on different branches and combine them together automatically)



#####Git Tag Recap
To recap, the git tag command is used to add a marker on a specific commit. The tag does not move around as new commits are added.

--->git tag -a beta
			This command will:
				add a tag to the most recent commit
				add a tag to a specific commit if a SHA is passed
				
#####Git Branch Recap
A branch is used to do development or make a fix to the project that won't affect the project (since the changes are made on a branch). 
To recap, the git branch command is used to manage branches in Git:

		# to list all branches
	--->git branch

		# to create a new "footer-fix" branch
	--->git branch footer-fix

		# to delete the "footer-fix" branch
	--->git branch -d footer-fix
	
		# to force delete the "footer-fix" branch (Don't ever use this)
	--->git branch -D footer-fix
	
	This command is used to:
		list out local branches
		create new branches
		remove branchess
		
ðŸ’¡ Switch and Create Branch In One CommandðŸ’¡
			Did you know that the git checkout command can actually create a new branch, too? 
			If you provide the -b flag, you can create a branch and switch to it all in one command.
	--->git checkout -b richards-branch-for-awesome-changes

The --graph flag adds the bullets and lines to the leftmost part of the output. 
This shows the actual branching that's happening. The --all flag is what displays all of the branches in the repository.
	
	--->git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

######Git Merge Recap
	To recap, the git merge command is used to combine branches in Git:

--->git merge <other-branch>

	There are two types of merges:
		1. Fast-forward merge â€“ the branch being merged in must be ahead of the checked out branch.
		   The checked out branch's pointer will just be moved forward to point to the same commit as the other branch.
		2. the regular type of merge
				two divergent branches are combined
				a merge commit is created
######Merge Conflict Recap
	A merge conflict happens when the same line or lines have been changed on different branches that are being merged.
	Git will pause mid-merge telling you that there is a conflict and will tell you in what file or files the conflict occurred.
	
	To resolve the conflict in a file:
		locate and remove all lines with merge conflict indicators
		determine what to keep
		save the file(s)
		stage the file(s)
		make a commit
	Be careful that a file might have merge conflicts in multiple parts of the file, so make sure you check the entire file for
	merge conflict indicators - a quick search for <<< should help you locate all of them.


6 ========================== Undoing Changes ==========================

		--->git commit --amend
		--->git revert
		--->git reset

--->git commit --amend
	You've already made plenty of commits with the git commit command. Now with the --amend flag, you can alter the most-recent commit.
	(Eg: So you'd make changes to the necessary CSS and/or HTML files to get the forgotten link styled correctly, 
	     then you'd save all of the files that were modified, then you'd use git add to stage all of the modified 
		 files (just as if you were going to make a new commit!), but then you'd run git commit --amend to update 
		 the most-recent commit instead of creating a new one.)

######  Revert Recap
		To recap, the git revert command is used to reverse a previously made commit:

--->git revert <SHA-of-commit-to-revert>
		This command:
			* will undo the changes that were made by the provided commit
			* creates a new commit to record the change

#######  Reset Recap
		To recap, the git reset command is used erase commits:

	--->git reset <reference-to-commit>
		
			It can be used to:
				move the HEAD and current branch pointer to the referenced commit
				erase commits with the --hard flag
				moves committed changes to the staging index with the --soft flag
				unstages committed changes --mixed flag
				
		Typically, ancestry references are used to indicate previous commits. The ancestry references are:
				^ â€“ indicates the parent commit
				~ â€“ indicates the first parent commit
